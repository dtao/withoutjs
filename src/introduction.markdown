# Nav without JS

This page is an illustration of a hack I came up a while ago, to provide familiar single-page
navigation behavior (you know, click a link and the visible section changes) without JavaScript
enabled.

You can see for yourself that this doesn't require JS: just check the source (no `<script>` tags!).
If you're still skeptical, go ahead and disable JavaScript in your browser and refresh the page.

Of course, it's really just a gimmick because the hack *does* require a modern browser (for CSS3
support). Which means it almost certainly doesn't make sense to use in production.

Anyway, the hack is one I haven't seen illustrated elsewhere. That doesn't mean no one else has come
up with it. Go ahead and check out the next section to learn how it works.
