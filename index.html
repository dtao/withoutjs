                        <p>
                            This page is an illustration of a hack I came up a while ago, to provide
                            familiar single-page navigation behavior (you know, click a link and the
                            visible section changes) without JavaScript enabled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can see for yourself that this doesn't require JS: just check the
                            source (no <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags!). If you're still
                            skeptical, go ahead and disable JavaScript in your browser and refresh
                            the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, it's really just a gimmick because the hack <em>does</em>
                            require a modern browser (for CSS3 support). Which means it
                            <del>almost</del> certainly doesn't make sense to use in production.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, the hack is one I haven't seen illustrated elsewhere. That
                            doesn't mean no one else has come up with it. Go ahead and check out the
                            next section to learn how it works.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <span class="section-link">Introduction</span>
                </label>
            </li>

            <li>
                <label>
                    <input name="section" value="How it works" type="radio" />

                    <section id="how-it-works">
                        <h1>How it works</h1>

                        <p>There are basically three parts to this hack:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                You can conditionally style checkbox and radio input elements based
                                on the <code>:checked</code> pseudo-selector.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you wrap a checkbox or radio input in a
                                <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, the entire container is clickable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You can also style the element immediately <em>after</em> one
                                matching a given selector using the <code>+</code> (adjacent
                                sibling) selector.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            With all that in mind, here's the hack. We use <em>hidden</em> radio
                            input elements to toggle state on the page. Those get wrapped in
                            <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements styled however we like. For example,
                            the "button" to show the nav menu up left is just a
                            <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> with an
                            <code>&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</code> (hidden) inside it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Immediately after these hidden inputs in the DOM we have the elements we
                            want to show. For example, after the nav elements are
                            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> containers (such as this one). Then in the
                            CSS the <code>section</code> element is hidden by default, unless it is
                            immediately after a checked input:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="lang-css">section {
    display: none;
}

input[type="radio"]:checked + section {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            So that's the basic idea. You can take a closer look at the HTML and CSS
                            to fully understand it.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <span class="section-link">How it works</span>
                </label>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <label id="overlay">
        <!-- This hidden element *hides* the nav. -->
        <input name="nav-toggle" value="hidden" type="radio" />
    </label>

    <span id="show-nav">&equiv;</span>
</label>
