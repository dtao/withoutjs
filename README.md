# Without JS

The idea for this repo is to illustrate some tricks to get behavior you would normally expect to
require JavaScript, without JavaScript.

Right now the one trick being illustrated is single-page nav with a sliding side bar. [Check out the
demo.](http://danieltao.com/withoutjs/)

If I'm not lazy, I will add more tricks in the future. (But that's a big *if*!)
